# ish
a dumb little shell that uses iteration as a first class citizen. It's primary feature is that you can prefix any command with a number to lopp the command that many times.

### usage
```bash
> ls
README.md  ish	main.c
> 10 ls
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
README.md  ish	main.c
>
```
